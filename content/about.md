Hello! My name is Aditya Jain. I am an engineer/designer with a background in data visualization. I currently work as a Software Engineer at [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/)'s News Engineering team.

I am a recent graduate from New York University's [ITP Program](https://itp.nyu.edu/)

In the past I have had the privilege of working with the wonderful people at [Fast Forward Labs](https://www.cloudera.com/products/fast-forward-labs-research.html), [The Library of Congress](https://labs.loc.gov/), [CQ Rollcall](https://cqrollcall.com/) and [The Wire](http://thewire.in/).
