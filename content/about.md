Hello! My name is Aditya Jain. I am a frontend engineer with a deep background in data visualization. I am a graduate student at New York University's [ITP Program](https://itp.nyu.edu/) and also work as an engineer at [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/)'s news engineering team.

I graduated from the [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://www.uic.edu/) in 2015, with a Bsc. in Computer Science. (and also studied Art, Design and other mischief)

In the past I have had the privilege of working with the wonderful people at [Fast Forward Labs](https://www.cloudera.com/products/fast-forward-labs-research.html), [The Library of Congress](https://labs.loc.gov/), [CQ Rollcall](https://cqrollcall.com/) and [The Wire](http://thewire.in/).
